Section A: Limitations of RDBMS (Relational Databases)
Relational databases like MySQL are well-suited for structured and consistent data but struggle when dealing with highly diverse and evolving product information. In FlexiMart’s case, products across categories such as electronics, apparel, and footwear have very different attributes. For example, laptops require specifications like RAM, processor, and storage, while shoes need size, color, and material. In a relational database, this leads to frequent schema changes or the creation of many nullable columns, resulting in sparse tables and poor design.
Additionally, relational schemas are rigid, making frequent schema modifications expensive and risky when new product types are introduced. Another major limitation is handling nested data such as customer reviews. Reviews must be stored in separate tables and joined repeatedly, which increases query complexity and reduces performance. As product variety and review volume grow, these joins become inefficient and harder to maintain, making RDBMS less suitable for this use case.


Section B: Benefits of MongoDB 
MongoDB addresses these limitations through its flexible, document-based data model. Each product is stored as a JSON-like document, allowing different products to have different attributes without altering a global schema. This flexibility makes MongoDB ideal for handling diverse product categories such as electronics, clothing, and accessories within the same collection.
MongoDB also supports embedded documents, enabling customer reviews to be stored directly inside the product document. This eliminates the need for complex joins and improves read performance, especially for use cases like displaying product details along with reviews. Furthermore, MongoDB is designed for horizontal scalability through sharding, allowing FlexiMart to efficiently handle growing product catalogs and increasing traffic. These features make MongoDB a strong choice for managing dynamic, semi-structured product data.


Section C: Trade-offs of Using MongoDB
Despite its advantages, MongoDB has some drawbacks compared to relational databases. One limitation is weaker support for complex transactions across multiple documents, which can be critical in financial or order-processing systems. Although MongoDB supports transactions, they are generally less mature and more resource-intensive than those in traditional RDBMS.
Another trade-off is the lack of enforced schema and foreign key constraints, which places more responsibility on the application layer to maintain data consistency. This can lead to data quality issues if not carefully managed. Therefore, MongoDB is best suited for flexible catalog and content data, while relational databases remain preferable for transactional systems.
